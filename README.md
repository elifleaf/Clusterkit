Clusterkit
==========

The code is mainly designed for applying cluster algorithms for description of energetics, measurement of thermodynamic properties and diffusion simulations. The aimed system of this code isi multicomponent disorder solid solutions, with typically more than 3 constituent elements. As a result, we would design atomic simulations mainly within NVT/NPT ensembles.
